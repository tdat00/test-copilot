it shows 60 records for each hour in CalHeatmap. I just want 12 records for each hour, each record represent 5 minute of data in heatmapData. You need to add custom template.

it doesn't work, you need to add custom template for the subDomain

no, you need to add new template function using CalHeatmap v4

No. Revert your previous change. Add custom "5 minutes" template reference to this document https://cal-heatmap.com/docs/template#days-subdomain-showing-only-the-weekdays

add 5minTemplate.js base on this file https://github.com/wa0x6e/cal-heatmap/blob/master/src/templates/minute.ts





remove subDomain from calheatmap, change domain type to hour
