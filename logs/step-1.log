```
GitHub Copilot
To create a Node.js application that displays a GitHub-style commits graph (calendar heatmap) using time series data from data.json, here’s what I’ll do:

Set up a basic Node.js + Express server.
Serve a static HTML page with a frontend (using a library like cal-heatmap or d3.js for the graph).
Load data.json on the backend and expose an API endpoint to serve the data.
The frontend fetches the data and renders the heatmap.
I will create the following files in c:\git\FHL\test-copilot:

server.js (Express server)
public/index.html (Frontend page)
public/app.js (Frontend JS for fetching data and rendering the graph)
public/style.css (Basic styles)
data.json (Sample time series data)
Let’s start by creating these files.
